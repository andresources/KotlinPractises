/****
    run vs let
    ----------
    run referces to the context of an object is "this" -> remove the redunacy
    let referces to the context of an object is "it" ->  it can be renamed with  readable lambda parameter.
    The “ run ” operator also helps in easy null checks similar to the “ let ” operator
